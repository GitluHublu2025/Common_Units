# Common Units Converter (from Common Units.pdf)

This Streamlit app uses only the conversion factors and exact unit text found in 'Common Units.pdf' (Table 1-6).
Units are presented exactly as they appear in the PDF. The UI shows a radio button list of 'From' units. Once a 'From' unit is selected, only the 'To' units that have explicit multiply-by factors in the PDF are displayed for conversion.
